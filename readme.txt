Scan on-page seo factors and get insight of your website. Aligned with Google webmaster guidelines.

== Description ==

Scan many on-page search engine optimization factors of your webpages. Scanning factors are mostly selected from Google webmaster guidelines, as it's standard.

When you request a scan, the plugin sends a crawler robot to webpages and crawls the content along with other related data.

The report will contain an overall analysis of the webpage in 3 aspects:
1. `header` tags analysis.
2. Text and image content analysis
3. Usability and speed analysis.
Also overview in report is presented beautifully for easy understand. 'Social media popularity' can be found by counts of with Google +1s, Facebook shares and Tweets.

NOTE: You can scan all published pages from various post types, including those you created by other plugins.
